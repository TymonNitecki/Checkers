# MiniCheckurs
* A 6x6 board checkers game implementing piskel art and object-orientated logic to move pieces and register different moves.
## Project Features and Goals
* Moveable pieces exclusive to different opponents or an individual on different rounds
* Creating diagnol movements
* A registeration of kill moves such as jumping over a piece
* Creating a crowning move at the end of the board that will change the graphics of the checkers piece and its movability
* Creating a start screen and scoreboard that allows the user(s) to play multiple rounds
## UI and Logic Planning
